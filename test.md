# Test Document with Emdashes

This is a test document, created specifically to test the emdash removal command. It contains various examples of emdashes in different contexts.

## Examples of Emdashes in Use

The project was successful (exceeding all expectations) and delivered on time. The team worked hard to achieve this goal, something that seemed impossible at first.

Here are some key points:
- The deadline was tight (only three weeks to complete everything)
- The budget was limited, so we had to be creative with resources
- The requirements changed multiple times during development

## More Context Examples

The application uses React (a popular JavaScript library) for building user interfaces. The database is SQLite (lightweight and perfect for development), though we might switch to PostgreSQL for production.

Performance was crucial (users expect fast loading times), so we implemented several optimizations. The virtual file system approach (storing components in memory rather than on disk) proved to be very effective.

## Final Thoughts

This document (filled with emdashes) should provide a good test case for the removal command. The emdashes appear in various contexts (some for emphasis, others for parenthetical remarks) and should be replaced appropriately.
